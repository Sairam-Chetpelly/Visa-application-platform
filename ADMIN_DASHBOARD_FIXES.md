# Admin Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Server Completion
- **Problem**: The backend server file was incomplete and cut off at line 1000+
- **Fix**: Completed the backend server with all necessary endpoints
- **Files Modified**: `scripts/backend-server.js`

### 2. Missing API Endpoints
- **Problem**: Admin dashboard was trying to call endpoints that didn't exist
- **Fix**: Added all required endpoints for admin functionality:
  - `/api/employees` - Get all employees
  - `/api/customers` - Get all customers  
  - `/api/payments` - Get all payments
  - `/api/dashboard/stats` - Get dashboard statistics

### 3. Frontend Data Display Issues
- **Problem**: Lists for employees, customers, and payments were not showing
- **Fix**: 
  - Fixed data fetching with proper error handling
  - Added proper data mapping and display
  - Fixed table structures and data binding
  - Added missing icon imports

### 4. API Client Methods
- **Problem**: Some API client methods were missing or incorrect
- **Fix**: Ensured all required methods exist in `lib/api.ts`:
  - `getEmployees()`
  - `getCustomers()`
  - `getPayments()`
  - `updateEmployee()`
  - `deleteEmployee()`
  - `updateCustomer()`
  - `deleteCustomer()`

## Files Modified

1. **scripts/backend-server.js**
   - Completed the server implementation
   - Added all admin endpoints
   - Fixed duplicate endpoint issues
   - Added proper error handling

2. **app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx**
   - Fixed data fetching logic
   - Added proper error handling with Promise.allSettled
   - Completed payment table implementation
   - Added reports section
   - Fixed duplicate code issues
   - Added missing icon imports

3. **lib/api.ts**
   - Verified all required API methods exist
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces

## Testing

Created `test-admin-endpoints.js` to verify all endpoints are working:

```bash
node test-admin-endpoints.js
```

This script tests:
- Admin login
- All dashboard endpoints
- Data retrieval and display
- Error handling

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:server
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login as admin**:
   - Email: `admin@visaflow.com`
   - Password: `password123`

4. **Check each tab in admin dashboard**:
   - Overview: Should show statistics
   - Employees: Should show employee list with actions
   - Customers: Should show customer list with actions
   - Applications: Should show application list with actions
   - Payments: Should show payment list
   - Reports: Should show analytics

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Employee list displays with edit/delete actions
- ✅ Customer list displays with edit/delete actions
- ✅ Payment list displays with transaction details
- ✅ Dashboard statistics show correct numbers
- ✅ All CRUD operations work properly
- ✅ Error handling works correctly
- ✅ Data refreshes after operations

## Database Requirements

Make sure MongoDB is running and seeded:

```bash
# Setup MongoDB with sample data
npm run setup:mongodb

# Or manually start MongoDB
mongod --dbpath /path/to/your/db
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env`:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/visa_management_system
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check MongoDB connection**:
   ```bash
   mongosh
   use visa_management_system
   db.users.find({userType: 'admin'})
   ```

2. **Check backend logs**:
   - Look for MongoDB connection errors
   - Verify all endpoints are registered
   - Check for authentication issues

3. **Check frontend console**:
   - Look for API call errors
   - Verify token is being sent
   - Check network tab for failed requests

4. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   node test-admin-endpoints.js
   ```

## Additional Notes

- All endpoints now have proper authentication checks
- Error handling is implemented at both frontend and backend
- Data is properly formatted for display
- CRUD operations include proper validation
- The admin dashboard is now fully functional

The admin dashboard should now display all lists (employees, customers, payments) correctly and allow full management functionality.
