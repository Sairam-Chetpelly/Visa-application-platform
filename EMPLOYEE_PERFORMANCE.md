## Database Schema

The performance data is calculated from:

### Applications Collection
- `assignedTo`: Employee ID
- `status`: Application status (approved, rejected, under_review, etc.)
- `submittedAt`: When application was submitted
- `reviewedAt`: When application was reviewed
- `approvedAt`: When application was approved

### Application Status History Collection
- `changedBy`: Employee who made the status change
- `newStatus`: New status applied
- `oldStatus`: Previous status
- `createdAt`: When the change was made

### Employee Profile Collection
- `role`: Employee role (Senior Processor, Processor, Junior Processor)
- `employeeId`: Unique employee identifier
- `hireDate`: When employee was hired

## Performance Calculations

### Approval Rate
```javascript
const approvalRate = totalDecisions > 0 ? 
  Math.round((approvedCount / totalDecisions) * 100) : 0
```

### Average Processing Time
```javascript
const avgProcessingTime = completedApplications.length > 0 ? 
  Math.round(totalProcessingTime / completedApplications.length) : 0
```

### Recent Activity (30 days)
```javascript
const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date(today.getTime() - (30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000))
const recentProcessed = processedApplications.filter(history => 
  history.createdAt >= thirtyDaysAgo
).length
```

## Usage

### For Employees
1. Navigate to `/employee-performance` from the employee dashboard
2. View your personal performance metrics
3. Use insights to improve productivity and quality

### For Administrators

## Testing

Run the performance test script:
```bash
npm run test-performance
```

This will:
1. Login as a test employee
2. Fetch performance data
3. Display metrics in the console
4. Test with multiple employees

## Performance Insights Logic

### Approval Performance
- **Excellent (â‰¥80%)**: "Your approval rate is excellent. Keep up the quality work!"
- **Good (â‰¥60%)**: "Good approval rate. Consider reviewing rejection patterns."
- **Needs Improvement (<60%)**: "Focus on understanding application requirements better."
- **No Data**: "No decisions made yet. Start processing applications to see your performance."

### Processing Speed
- **Excellent (â‰¤3 days)**: "Excellent processing speed! You're very efficient."
- **Good (â‰¤7 days)**: "Good processing time. Consider streamlining your workflow."
- **Needs Improvement (>7 days)**: "Try to reduce processing time while maintaining quality."
- **No Data**: "No completed applications yet to calculate processing time."

### Workload Balance
- **No Load (0)**: "No current assignments. Ready to take on new applications."
- **Light (â‰¤5)**: "Light workload. Ready to take on more applications."
- **Balanced (â‰¤15)**: "Balanced workload. Managing well."
- **Heavy (>15)**: "Heavy workload. Consider prioritizing urgent applications."
